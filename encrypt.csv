Puneet does his home work before releasing wireframes, the wireframes comply with NGAF components ensuring ease of development for the developers.


Puneet has always turned around clarifications and bug fixes at the earliest ensuring no blockers for developers. He also conducts knowledge transfer sessions before the start of the iteration. There has not been any instance of conflicts with any one from mindtree or SITA.


The work done by Puneet on the business dashboard and the idea jam was outstanding. Puneet's wireframes were one of the main reasons for his team being nominated in the final 5 of the idea Jam competition.

1. Deepa is very precise and effective in her communications. She proactively brings issues to notice and does not require constant supervision of her work.

3. I can say that there were zero escalations (from Deepa side) as Deepa is precise and proactive in her communication.
4. Deepa involved herself in low level design review and is quick enough to find the desgin gaps (3 design gaps found), which if not identified would have added to the rework and project cost at the later stages of the project.
What can be Improved:
1. Deepa can work to maintain this communication skill in future and improve on the same",1562
"1936","What Went Well:

Deepa ensured that the BIS jobs that were migrated from Pentaho work for Mondelez. Along with this, the retailer level changes were incorporated. She made sure that the data was loaded, though it took little time, she was able to successfully run the jobs for History and ongoing weeks.

Deepa along with Prasanth, were able to run the DB procedures that we specifically developed for modern market. The data was validated and made sure that the old system and the new system are in sync

Deepa is a very good team player, good developer, and takes the complete ownership of the assigned task and delivery it. However there were few instances where it has taken little longer time and I feel that could have been avoided. Also, it would have helped her if she could have understood the APEX functionality better.



What can be Improved:



As a next steps, Deepa should get involved in design end to end solution for the data ingestion area.


Deepa should be able to define the end to end process to make sure all the requirements are met, both functional, technical and operational.ÿ


Deepa should also spend time in understanding APEX platform in both functional and from Data requirements side.

3. There were only 12 defects opened and the the rework percentage was very less (<10%)
4. There were only 3 defect opened in the Server Integration and in the Integration platform the rework % is zero

2. Deepa can work hard to reduce the rework percentage in the System Testing.

2. Code quality metrics ÿtools are not used in APEX but I am sure Deepa's output would meet metrics we use in customer delivery projects.
3. Deepa is a proactive team member , this is evident during APEX to BIS migration, when she is waiting for the Engineering team to give the initial Infra set up, she took initiative to do the DB migration as a parallel activity. This helped in saving the idle time which enhanced the timely delivery of the project

Yedu is involved in the creation of user manual documents for Painters project. He comes from the rich experience of creating userÿdocuments for Flourish project which is also based on the same GPP platform. With his prior knowledge in GPP, he quickly picked upÿthe functionalities of Painters project. He could successfully create 54 user manual documents within the planned time lines. Theÿdocuments were presented to the Product owner when he visited Bangalore and was well received.
Yedu is also part of user training. He had given pilot training to the AkzoNobel team. Recently, Yedu along with the client roll outÿmanager gave training to the Sweden market. Feedback from the training was very positive, and customer also appreciated the goodÿwork done by Yedu and team.


The content template document that was created is of high quality. The document is well organized and easily understandable for aÿnewly inducted Market person.


Apart from Documentation and training Yedu is also helping the customer by doing he content upload activity. This in turn enabled himÿto unearth most of the issues related to back end authoring and publishing to live. The dedication that he has shown in these tasksÿeven though it is not his primary responsibility is commendable.


As part of the back up plan, Yedu has trained a junior BA on GPP, and brought her up to speed in a short period of time.


There were some instances where before him communicating to customer on any of the changes, he could have discussed in detail withÿthe development team to understand the requirement more clearly.


Feedback from Sandhya:

Within limited opportunity of training documentation creation & training people, Yedu has ensured that he has always delivered highest quality documents. ÿHe has volunteered and has taken up additional tasks like data upload & while doing this he has identified several existing issues in the sites and have got them fixed. He has now become a critical resource in the project.",113

Is well connected with the IG presales network, Delivery and solution team network and is able to get work done through relationships with these people.

"3970","Shashi has been an outstanding contributor to the digital presales team.


Key Contributions

Has delivered proposals in the role of an end to end bid manager (especially for TTH presales) as well as of presales Business Analyst

Has the ability to drive end to end presales single handedly, as was in the case of Al-Farah and Evoqua proposals (being the large ones)

Follows presales processes and sees to that nothing in the process falls through the crack

Works well with the delivery teams and provides inputs from a delivery perspective

Sets up the right expectations from each of the team members leading to effective contribution from the team

Proactively identifies issues and seeks resolutions

Participates in presales customer meetings

Clear and concise communication to the teams to avoid ambiguities

Does not shy away from working long hours or on weekends

Handles Multi-tower proposals

Is well planned and focused on delivering quality proposals and on time

"3972","Over the last year, Shashi's email writing capabilities have improved to be more concise, clear and to the point. This improvement is reflected in MoM emails, team communication and other categories.

At this point the primary source of self development for Shashi is the knowledge that he gains on-job while handling multi-tower proposals. This happens when Shashi reads through the RFP documents and requirements in details, understands the business need and objectives and also when he is deeply involved in the solution development activities. Shashi is also able to bring in the learnings from previous proposals on to the new ones, making it possible to have a base thought process to deliver the proposal.


While this will help Shashi from a self development through knowledge acquisition on different areas, certifications would really help Shashi and he has to spend time on the same.

",5309
"3973","Shashi is one of the sought out person by the BFSI, TTH and RCM teams and these IG presales ask Shashi to be involved in the RFP Bids and has a healthy working and personal relationship with other teams (Delivery, solution etc.).


Feedback from peers / colleagues / ADM / BDM Etc. is as provided in the Operational excellence goals


Key Strengths

Gels well with any type of team composition

Simplifies team member work by assigning specific tasks and work items

Is well planned

Guides the team on the presales processes as well as on the functional aspects and direction of the overall proposal

Builds good personal as well as professional relationship with the team members

Sunil worked on the HCCB project for a duration of three months. During this stint he was given the responsibility of the creation of the Technical Design document for Procurement . He required constant guidance throughout the process, while he worked hard to try and complete the same on time, there was a delay in the delivery owing to incompleteness and multiple review iterations.ÿ

Having minimal knowledge on the Salesforce platform, there needed a lot more effort towards learning that had to be put in from his side to be on par with the other leads which at most times was missingÿ

He then took on the development track for the Procurement module, but could not make much progress independently .

Ability to play the role of Module Lead needs significant improvementÿ

Vijay had taken up creation of the TDD documents for two function areas during the Definition Phase - HR and SCM.ÿ

He had done a decent job in capturing the same, however due to time and bandwidth constraints there were areas which were not clearly documentedÿ

During implementation Phase, he was solely responsible for the Function Area - SCM. However, due to frequent absence / unavailability a lot of work got delegated to the team members which made the developers struggle to complete the tasks. Frequent reviews and mentoring at times was completely missing. There were many instances where directions given by the Architect were not adhered to leading to overall a lot of misses/gaps in the implementation.ÿ

Technically strong but could have been a little more committed towards the project delivery ÿ

Need to perform self review of the code implemented and ensure to analyze in all aspects of the application architecture so that it does
