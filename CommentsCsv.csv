He has been very good at communicating and keeping the team informed on required projected related items.


He has delivered very good quality of code in HMIS process time addition. This has helped us improve the daily load time by 45 mins.

Nishi has recently moved to support track and his work has been well appreciated.





ÿThings To Improve:


He needs to ensure that he takes complete ownership of the work assigned to him. There have been instances when this has been missed and caused delivery impacts. Eg. MIRS Universe promotion to systest for Farming Prop 1610 release.


Quality of the deliverable can be increased by performing proper unit testing. There have been instances when there were high number of defects in the delivered code. Eg. HMIS reports for Farming Prop In 1610 release.

Mxlxhyye,This is one more NN customer where the success of the engagement is largely owed to Sandeep. He approached the solution and also guided the team towards a successful deployment.

Mxlxhyye,,4.5
Mxlxhyye,T&F was a new NN account for Mindtree and this was a very crucial engagement. Sandeep was instrumental in making this successful.

He reasearched new AWS tools and worked relentlessly hard towards making this possible.,4.5

Sujana played the role of data modeler to design Redshift Database for the bigbasket DW/BI project . Sujana's work on Data modeling is much recognizable.

Sujana has developed many modules in the bigbasket project and her thought process for any of the modules assigned is much appreciated. This helped out in ironing out most of the issues.
Sujana also helped her team members wherever possible to suggest and resolve issues.
Due to project resource crunch, Sujana was assigned the task of completing the functional requirements flowcharts. She has participated in the bigbasket customer meetings and she guided and understood the requirements clearly and documented the same and received the sign-off from the customer. Her contribution in completing the functional requirements is much appreciated.
During the business sessions, Sujana showed good communication skills and made sure all the requirements are clarified well within time and made sure all are captured as part of the documentation.
Based on her work during Phase 1 of the bigbasket project, she was assigned the much complex session and marketing channel logic. Sujana was ready to take up the challenge and she developed the session and marketing channel logic.
Sujana took up the work of completing the JSON path files and schema creation for Clickstream staging tables and completed her work on time.",4.5

Puneet does his home work before releasing wireframes, the wireframes comply with NGAF components ensuring ease of development for the developers.


Puneet has always turned around clarifications and bug fixes at the earliest ensuring no blockers for developers. He also conducts knowledge transfer sessions before the start of the iteration. There has not been any instance of conflicts with any one from mindtree or SITA.


The work done by Puneet on the business dashboard and the idea jam was outstanding. Puneet's wireframes were one of the main reasons for his team being nominated in the final 5 of the idea Jam competition.

1. Deepa is very precise and effective in her communications. She proactively brings issues to notice and does not require constant supervision of her work.

2. Since her communication is precise this Managers and Peers are able to foresee the issues well in advance and avoid issues and escalation.
3. I can say that there were zero escalations (from Deepa side) as Deepa is precise and proactive in her communication.
4. Deepa involved herself in low level design review and is quick enough to find the desgin gaps (3 design gaps found), which if not identified would have added to the rework and project cost at the later stages of the project.
What can be Improved:
1. Deepa can work to maintain this communication skill in future and improve on the same",4
Mxlaetee,"What Went Well:

Deepa ensured that the BIS jobs that were migrated from Pentaho work for Mondelez. Along with this, the retailer level changes were incorporated. She made sure that the data was loaded, though it took little time, she was able to successfully run the jobs for History and ongoing weeks.

Deepa along with Prasanth, were able to run the DB procedures that we specifically developed for modern market. The data was validated and made sure that the old system and the new system are in sync

Deepa is a very good team player, good developer, and takes the complete ownership of the assigned task and delivery it. However there were few instances where it has taken little longer time and I feel that could have been avoided. Also, it would have helped her if she could have understood the APEX functionality better.



What can be Improved:



As a next steps, Deepa should get involved in design end to end solution for the data ingestion area.


Deepa should be able to define the end to end process to make sure all the requirements are met, both functional, technical and operational.ÿ


Deepa should also spend time in understanding APEX platform in both functional and from Data requirements side.

Mxlaetee,"What Went Well:1.Deepa along with other team members has migrated all the pentaho ETL jobs to BIS.ÿThough it took little longer time, the job was done successfully. SCRUM was used in this project and all the processes were diligently followed.
2. There were around 40 Jobs out of which Deepa owned and developed 25 jobs of varied complexity in a duration span of 8 weeks
3. There were only 12 defects opened and the the rework percentage was very less (<10%)
4. There were only 3 defect opened in the Server Integration and in the Integration platform the rework % is zero


What can be Improved:
1. Deepa can continue to follow the processes diligently in her future projects
2. Deepa can work hard to reduce the rework percentage in the System Testing.

Mxlaetee,"What Went Well:

Deepa comes from the ÿETL background, this helped her in using the BIS tool well. She was able to develop BIS jobs to handle APEX data ingestion requirements. SCRUM methodology was used for the development of BIS jobs.


ÿShe is a good team player, very good developer and very committed. She has the capability to handle a team of developers and she should start exploring it.




What can be Improved:

As next steps, she should start learning .Net code that is needed to use the BIS tool better. She should also start learning the Data ingestion design patterns and concepts well.ÿ


Deepa should start owning the ETL design based on the requirement and should be able to manage a team of developers.

Mxlaetee,,4
Mxlaetee,"What went well:
1. Deepa completes her assignments on time. In cases where there could be issues or delays she communicates them proactively.ÿThe quality of her work is good and largely free of defects.ÿ
2. Code quality metrics ÿtools are not used in APEX but I am sure Deepa's output would meet metrics we use in customer delivery projects.
3. Deepa is a proactive team member , this is evident during APEX to BIS migration, when she is waiting for the Engineering team to give the initial Infra set up, she took initiative to do the DB migration as a parallel activity. This helped in saving the idle time which enhanced the timely delivery of the project


What can be Improved:
1. In future Deepa can capture the quality metrics and compare with the actual.

Mxlyxyeh,No White Paper has been created by Bhawna in the previous year. It is essential for her to leverage on her vast experience and knowledge and translate that into a White Paper/Case Study which can enable to enhance her knowledge even more. My feedback would be for her to work on 2 areas in the coming 2 quarters - Web Analytic - New Age Requirement and Website Experimentation and how it is relevant in the current era of Personalization.,4
Mxlyxyeh,,4
Mxlyxyeh,,4
Mxlyxyeh,Bhawna has spent a quite bit of time learning concept of Big Data and has been able to complete couple of certifications in this area. The ask here would be to go ahead and enrich her learning by doing a self assessment of her learning in the tools that she has been able to train herself on. I would recommend her to go ahead and spend sometime working on these tools on couple of use cases which can then be leveraged for any work that comes up in this space. She has the capability and the knowledge to go ahead and get this done in the coming quarter.,4
Mxlyxyeh,Bhawna has contributed quite significantly in the last year in the RFP's and POC's that she has taken the lead on and she has been able to drive some of these on her own with very little or no supervision. The most valuable contributions in the RFP side was highlighted in the hard work that she had put in for Lufthansa and Al-Farah both of which were very challenging with multiple requirement and minute details which were required to be put together.,4
Mxlyxyeh,,4
Mxlyxyeh,,4
Mxlyxyeh,Bhawna has provided significant contribution in the space of Skill Development and has been keen to pick up new skills which would be beneficial to her and also to the team. Over the last year one significant learning that she has put in is to learn Website Experimentation (A/B Testing) end to end and she has translated this learning in a live project for AkzoNobel. The client has been appreciative of her knowledge and her ability to communicate details quickly and efficiently. Keep the good learning in the new year as well.,4

All the User Manuals that he has created have been well receivedÿ


During Release 2, he was responsible for few of the flows in Procurement and F/A.ÿ


Always worked with the back end development team to ensure flows are implemented correctly.

Mxlyxeeg,"Feedback fromÿGeorge K Thomas:
Yedu is involved in the creation of user manual documents for Painters project. He comes from the rich experience of creating userÿdocuments for Flourish project which is also based on the same GPP platform. With his prior knowledge in GPP, he quickly picked upÿthe functionalities of Painters project. He could successfully create 54 user manual documents within the planned time lines. Theÿdocuments were presented to the Product owner when he visited Bangalore and was well received.
Yedu is also part of user training. He had given pilot training to the AkzoNobel team. Recently, Yedu along with the client roll outÿmanager gave training to the Sweden market. Feedback from the training was very positive, and customer also appreciated the goodÿwork done by Yedu and team.


The content template document that was created is of high quality. The document is well organized and easily understandable for aÿnewly inducted Market person.


Apart from Documentation and training Yedu is also helping the customer by doing he content upload activity. This in turn enabled himÿto unearth most of the issues related to back end authoring and publishing to live. The dedication that he has shown in these tasksÿeven though it is not his primary responsibility is commendable.


As part of the back up plan, Yedu has trained a junior BA on GPP, and brought her up to speed in a short period of time.


There were some instances where before him communicating to customer on any of the changes, he could have discussed in detail withÿthe development team to understand the requirement more clearly.


Feedback from Sandhya:

Within limited opportunity of training documentation creation & training people, Yedu has ensured that he has always delivered highest quality documents. ÿHe has volunteered and has taken up additional tasks like data upload & while doing this he has identified several existing issues in the sites and have got them fixed. He has now become a critical resource in the project.",4

-ÿWell documented defects - To ensure all defects raised to development team are well documented with background, analysis, test data, scenarios, steps taken by support & any observations made by L2 support team

-ÿIt is also important that you understand the actual issue and analyze the impact on making changes to the system.

Mxlyaxaj,"Over the last year, Shashi's email writing capabilities have improved to be more concise, clear and to the point. This improvement is reflected in MoM emails, team communication and other categories.

At this point the primary source of self development for Shashi is the knowledge that he gains on-job while handling multi-tower proposals. This happens when Shashi reads through the RFP documents and requirements in details, understands the business need and objectives and also when he is deeply involved in the solution development activities. Shashi is also able to bring in the learnings from previous proposals on to the new ones, making it possible to have a base thought process to deliver the proposal.


While this will help Shashi from a self development through knowledge acquisition on different areas, certifications would really help Shashi and he has to spend time on the same.

",4.5
Mxlyaxaj,"Shashi is one of the sought out person by the BFSI, TTH and RCM teams and these IG presales ask Shashi to be involved in the RFP Bids and has a healthy working and personal relationship with other teams (Delivery, solution etc.).


Feedback from peers / colleagues / ADM / BDM Etc. is as provided in the Operational excellence goals


Key Strengths

Gels well with any type of team composition

Simplifies team member work by assigning specific tasks and work items

Is well planned

Guides the team on the presales processes as well as on the functional aspects and direction of the overall proposal

Builds good personal as well as professional relationship with the team members

Sunil worked on the HCCB project for a duration of three months. During this stint he was given the responsibility of the creation of the Technical Design document for Procurement . He required constant guidance throughout the process, while he worked hard to try and complete the same on time, there was a delay in the delivery owing to incompleteness and multiple review iterations.ÿ

Having minimal knowledge on the Salesforce platform, there needed a lot more effort towards learning that had to be put in from his side to be on par with the other leads which at most times was missingÿ

He then took on the development track for the Procurement module, but could not make much progress independently .

Ability to play the role of Module Lead needs significant improvementÿ

Further during the development stage, due to ill health he took a long 6 weeks break and has to be released from the project.ÿ

There is scope for him to look into areas that he has been working on for quite sometime and get the Use Cases and the steps documented which can then be successfully leveraged for multiple other projects and activities happening with in the practice.",4
Mxlytjlg,,4
Mxlytjlg,Narayan has been the pillar of this project on Tag Migration for P&G. He has been able to drive lot of things at his own end with minimum supervision and has received lot of accolades both internally from the team he has been working with and from the client. This was one of his first big projects and he has been able to successfully prove himself and leverage on his knowledge and capability. He also shouldered the additional responsibility of also hand holding Hindhuja and bringing her upto speed in Tag Management related topics. Excellent job and this is a real example of where someone can stand up and own the project end to end.,4
Mxlytjlg,,4
Mxlytjlg,An additional initiative was thrown at Narayan and with it came multiple challenges and opportunities. Narayan was quick to seize the opportunity and he was a go getter in this instance where he led the training for a week for an external partner with whom we are teaming up for our scalability on SEO space. Narayan also conducted multiple training sessions for the P&G team on SEO and the feedback received for these training has been great which spoke a lot about his dedication to the task he was carrying out and his eye for detail.,4
Mxlytjlg,,4
Mxlytjlg,Overall good courses selected for up skilling himself in the last year. The good point here is Narayan just not focused on the internal certifications and courses available through Yorbit but expanded his horizon to look out for courses from external sources as well which could enrich his knowledge and take him to the next level. He is keen to empower and enrich himself in lot of areas and this is visible in all the certifications that he has managed to do in the last year. Now the challenge to him would be to apply the knowledge gained in live projects and also share the knowledge with others in the team.,4

During implementation Phase, he was solely responsible for the Function Area - SCM.
